Ride_Hailing_Company_Churn_Ensemble
Project for Churn Analysis for a well known ride hailing company

CONTEXT & BUSINESS PROBLEM
Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry observers as a tough battle for ride-hailing companies. Churn among drivers is high — drivers may leave on the fly or move to other ride-hailing companies depending on rates or other factors. As the company scales, high churn becomes more costly and damaging. Acquiring new drivers (especially those without cars or prior experience) is expensive compared to retaining existing ones.

As a data scientist in the Analytics Department of “XYZ” (the ride hailing company), the task is to predict driver attrition/churn. You are provided with monthly data for a cohort of drivers over 2019 and 2020. Based on driver attributes and historical behavior, you need to build a model to predict whether a driver will leave the company (i.e., churn) or not.

ABOUT

Goal: Predict driver churn (yes/no) using driver attributes and historical monthly data.

Input: Monthly information for a segment of drivers (2019–2020) — features include driver attributes, monthly activity/behavior, possibly earnings, usage, etc.

Output: Binary prediction — whether driver will churn (leave) in next period or not.

PROJECT DELIVERABLES

A Jupyter notebook (Ride_hailing_company.ipynb) containing data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, modeling (likely ensemble methods), evaluation, and final predictions.
